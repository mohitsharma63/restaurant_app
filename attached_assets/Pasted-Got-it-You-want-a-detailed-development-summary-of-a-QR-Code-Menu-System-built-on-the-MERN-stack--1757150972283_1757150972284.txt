Got it 👍 You want a detailed development summary of a QR Code Menu System built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Here’s a structured breakdown:

📌 QR Code Menu System (MERN) – Development Summary

1. Project Overview

A contactless ordering solution where customers scan a QR code placed on their table to view the restaurant’s digital menu.

Customers can place dine-in, takeaway, or delivery orders directly from their phone.

Orders flow into the Restaurant Dashboard App for acceptance, preparation, and completion.

Supports online UPI/Wallet/Card payment and cash on delivery.



---

2. Tech Stack

Frontend (Customer App) → React.js + Tailwind CSS (for UI)

Backend API → Node.js + Express.js

Database → MongoDB (for menu, users, orders, payments, restaurants)

Authentication → JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Payment Gateway → Razorpay / Stripe / UPI integration

QR Code Generation → qrcode npm package

Real-time Updates → Socket.io (for order status changes in dashboard + customer side)



---

3. System Architecture

1. Customer Flow

Scan QR → React app opens menu → Select items → Add to cart → Checkout → Pay → Order placed.



2. Restaurant Dashboard Flow

Login → View live orders → Accept/Reject → Update status (Preparing, Ready, Served, Delivered).



3. Database Schema (MongoDB Collections)

Users: name, email, phone, role (customer/restaurant staff), password (hashed).

Restaurants: name, address, QR code, tables.

MenuItems: title, description, price, category, availability, restaurantId.

Orders: customerId, restaurantId, items[], totalAmount, status, paymentStatus, orderType (dine-in/takeaway/delivery).

Payments: orderId, method, amount, status, transactionId.

4. Core Features

✅ QR Code Generation → Each table generates a unique QR linking to /menu/:restaurantId/:tableId.
✅ Digital Menu → Responsive menu page with categories, filters, and item images.
✅ Cart & Checkout → Add/remove items, view cart, apply coupon codes.
✅ Payment Integration → Razorpay/Stripe for card, UPI, wallet support.
✅ Order Management → Orders stored in MongoDB, updates in real-time.
✅ Restaurant Dashboard → Accept/reject orders, change status, view analytics.
✅ Kitchen Display (optional) → Separate screen showing live orders for chefs.
✅ Notifications → Push notifications / SMS / WhatsApp alerts for order status.

5. Development Phases

Phase 1 – Setup

Initialize MERN boilerplate (frontend & backend).

Configure MongoDB Atlas cluster.

Setup user authentication with JWT.


Phase 2 – Customer App

Build menu UI in React.

Implement cart system with Context API/Redux.

Integrate QR code scanning & routing.


Phase 3 – Backend API

Create REST APIs for:

Menu retrieval (/menu/:restaurantId)

Order placement (/order/create)

Order tracking (/order/:id/status)


Secure routes with JWT (customer & restaurant roles).


Phase 4 – Payment Integration

Add Razorpay/Stripe checkout API.

Save payment details in Payments collection.


Phase 5 – Restaurant Dashboard

React app for restaurant staff:

Login & authentication.

Order listing with filters (Pending, Preparing, Ready, Completed).

Update order status (real-time via Socket.io).



Phase 6 – Real-time Updates

Implement Socket.io for:

Customer gets live order status updates.

Restaurant dashboard refreshes automatically on new order.



Phase 7 – Testing & Deployment

Test customer flow with sample QR codes.

Deploy:

Backend → Render/Heroku/AWS.

Frontend → Vercel/Netlify.

Database → MongoDB Atlas.




---

6. Deployment Flow

Generate restaurant QR → print & place on tables.

Customer scans → React app loads menu.

Orders processed via Node.js backend → stored in MongoDB.

Restaurant dashboard (separate React app) manages order lifecycle.



---

7. Future Enhancements

Multi-language support.

Analytics dashboard (sales, popular items, revenue trends).

Customer loyalty system (reward points, discounts).
