Got it 👍 You want a detailed development summary of a QR Code Menu System built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Here’s a structured breakdown:

📌 QR Code Menu System (MERN) – Development Summary

1. Project Overview

A contactless ordering solution where customers scan a QR code placed on their table to view the restaurant’s digital menu.

Customers can place dine-in, takeaway, or delivery orders directly from their phone.

Orders flow into the Restaurant Dashboard App for acceptance, preparation, and completion.

Supports online UPI/Wallet/Card payment and cash on delivery.

2. Tech Stack

Frontend (Customer App) → React.js + Tailwind CSS (for UI)

Backend API → Node.js + Express.js

Database → MongoDB (for menu, users, orders, payments, restaurants)

Authentication → JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Payment Gateway → Razorpay / Stripe / UPI integration

QR Code Generation → qrcode npm package

Real-time Updates → Socket.io (for order status changes in dashboard + customer side)

3. System Architecture

1. Customer Flow

Scan QR → React app opens menu → Select items → Add to cart → Checkout → Pay → Order placed.



2. Restaurant Dashboard Flow

Login → View live orders → Accept/Reject → Update status (Preparing, Ready, Served, Delivered).

Users: name, email, phone, role (customer/restaurant staff), password (hashed).

Restaurants: name, address, QR code, tables.

MenuItems: title, description, price, category, availability, restaurantId.

Orders: customerId, restaurantId, items[], totalAmount, status, paymentStatus, orderType (dine-in/takeaway/delivery).

Payments: orderId, method, amount, status, transactionId.
